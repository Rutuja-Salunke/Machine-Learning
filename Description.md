# Title: Predicting Health Insurance Costs
## Introduction:

In the realm of healthcare, understanding and predicting health insurance costs is of paramount importance. The ability to accurately estimate these costs can empower both insurance providers and individuals to make informed decisions. This project embarks on a journey to develop a predictive model for health insurance costs using real-world data sourced from Kaggle.

## Data Exploration:

Upon acquiring the dataset, the initial step involved scrutinizing the data to comprehend the nature of the problem. The dataset contained 1338 rows, each representing an insurance policy. It consisted of seven columns: ID, gender, BMI (Body Mass Index), children, location, age, and smoking status. The primary target variable was the health insurance cost.

## Data Integrity: The data appeared to be in good shape with no missing values except for a few in the 'children' column. These were promptly handled.

### Data Types: Categorical features included 'gender', 'location', and 'smoking status', while 'age', 'BMI', 'children', and 'health insurance cost' were numerical.

## Feature Engineering:

To facilitate the modeling process, categorical data was transformed into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding. Subsequently, potential outliers in the dataset were identified using box plots and addressed through a robust approach.

## Feature Selection:

Not all features were equally relevant in predicting health insurance costs. Correlation analysis revealed the most influential features. A refined dataset with a focus on these key variables was created.

## Modeling:

With a well-prepared dataset, the modeling phase commenced. Linear regression was the initial choice. However, the model achieved an R-squared score of 0.7569 on the training data and a similar score on the testing data. While it demonstrated good performance, there was room for improvement.

### Decision Trees:

To explore alternative algorithms, decision trees were introduced. Though decision trees tend to overfit, hyperparameter tuning was applied to mitigate this issue. After optimization, the model's performance was evaluated.

## Conclusion:

The project's ultimate objective was to predict health insurance costs accurately. The journey began with data acquisition, cleansing, and feature engineering. Outliers were addressed, and essential features were selected based on correlation analysis.

Initial modeling with linear regression yielded promising results but left room for improvement. Decision trees were introduced as an alternative, and with careful tuning, they showed promise in delivering better predictive power.

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the iterative and dynamic nature of machine learning. It highlights the importance of data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation in the pursuit of building accurate predictive models for real-world problems.

Future Directions:

The project could be further enhanced by exploring more advanced machine learning techniques, such as ensemble methods or neural networks. Additionally, incorporating more data sources, such as medical history and lifestyle factors, could lead to even more precise predictions of health insurance costs.
