# Title: Predicting Health Insurance Costs

## Introduction:

In the realm of healthcare, understanding and predicting health insurance costs is vital for both individuals and insurance providers. This project aims to develop a robust predictive model for health insurance costs using data sourced from Kaggle. Throughout the journey, three powerful algorithms will be employed: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
## Problem Statement:
To perform all data analysis steps and finally create a machine learning model which can predict the health insurance cost.

## Data Exploration:

### Dataset: 1338 rows, 7 columns
## Data Integrity: 
Checked for missing values - some in 'children' column
### Data Types: 
Categorical ('gender', 'location', 'smoking status') and Numerical ('age', 'BMI', 'children', 'health insurance cost')
## Feature Engineering:
To facilitate the modeling process, categorical data was transformed into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding. Subsequently, potential outliers in the dataset were identified using box plots and addressed through a robust approach.

- Conversion of categorical data to numerical form (one-hot encoding)
- Outlier detection and treatment using box plots
## Feature Selection:
Not all features were equally relevant in predicting health insurance costs. Correlation analysis revealed the most influential features. A refined dataset with a focus on these key variables was created.

- Identification of relevant features through correlation analysis
- Creation of a refined dataset with key variables
